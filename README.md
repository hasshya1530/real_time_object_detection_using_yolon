# real_tme_object_detection_using_yolon
This project implements real-time object recognition for video streams, webcam feeds, and still images, utilizing the YOLO algorithm. YOLO, which stands for "You Only Look Once," is an object recognition algorithm. The implementation is done in Python, using pre-trained weights.

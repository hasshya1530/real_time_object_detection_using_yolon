# real_time_object_detection_using_yolon
This project implements real-time object recognition for video streams, webcam feeds, and still images, utilizing the YOLO algorithm. YOLO, which stands for "You Only Look Once," is an object recognition algorithm. The implementation is done in Python, using pre-trained weights. 
he Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset was used for training the model.

Real-time detection can be performed via the command line or through a graphical user interface (GUI).

YOLO is a deep learning-based object detection method introduced in May 2016. It gained rapid popularity due to its speed advantage over earlier object detection techniques.  YOLO enables real-time object detection with relatively high processing speeds. A GPU can achieve frame rates exceeding 45 frames per second, while a CPU can process approximately one frame per second.

The OpenCV dnn module provides support for executing inference on pre-trained deep learning models from popular frameworks, including Caffe, Torch, and TensorFlow.
